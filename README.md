# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis
In this repository, we have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model


Here I have created two models, where the first one is without using any imbalance data handling, while the other is using the SMOTE-ENN method to balance the data.
I have applied decision tree and random forest classifier

Without using SMOTE-ENN to balance the data, the model performance that is produced is as follows.

Decision tree--> 79% accuracy Random Forest --> 78% accuracy

using the SMOTE-ENN method to balance the dataset that used in classification modeling, thus increasing the model performance

Decision tree--> 93% accuracy Random Forest --> 94.7% accuracy
